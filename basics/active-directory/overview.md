# Overview of Active Directory

## What is a directory?

- A directory is a fundamental service for distributed applications. It provides the following features:

|Feature|Description|Reason|
|:------|:----------|:-----|
|Location transparency|The ability to find user, group, service, or resource data _without the object address_.|Think: a phone book needs to allow you to find information without knowing the full details of what you're looking for.|
|Object data|The ability to store user, group, organization, and service data in a hierarchical tree.||
|Rich query|The ability to locate an object by querying for object properties.||
|High availability|The ability to locate a replica of the directory at a location that is efficient for read/write operations.||
