# Initial Access

## Basics

- How can we gain access to a target?
- Why do we gain access to this target?
- Where is the path of least resistance to our objective?
  - Who could we target?
  - Who should we target?
  - **Target people like you (your persona).** You need to be comfortable and familiar with the environment.
- Embrace nuance.

## Tactics
- **Don't reinvent the wheel. Teach your users to bypass controls the same way you taught yourself.**
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Emulate _real emails_ you get in your inbox.
