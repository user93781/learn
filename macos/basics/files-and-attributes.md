# Files: data, attributes, and extended attributes (APFS)

## Introduction

- In modern systems, Files consist of three types of data, often stored separately:
  1. **data** (a.k.a. the data fork)
    - the data that is read and written by applications.
  2. **attributes**
    - the metadata about the file: name, date of creation, permissions, etc.
  3. **extended attributes**
    - supplementary info about the data, richer than the attributes.

## Structure and data forks

### Sparse files
- Some files on macOS are automatically determined to be sparse files.

### Clones

## Attributes

## Extended Attributes
